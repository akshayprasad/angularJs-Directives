## What are Directives?
- At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) 
  that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element 
  (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

## What does it mean to "compile" an HTML template? 
- For AngularJS, "compilation" means attaching directives to the HTML to make it interactive.
- The reason we use the term "compile" is that the recursive process of attaching directives mirrors the process of compiling source code   in compiled programming languages.
